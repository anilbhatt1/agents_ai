She helped me visualize the design and the space in a way that I wanted that was also realistic and within budget.\\n\\nI live in colonial house built in the 40s. Very traditional design, with small enclosed living, dining, and kitchen spaces. It's also split by a staircase right in the center. I wanted a more open feel, and a more updated kitchen (kitchen had a partial wall that further cut the space). She gave me definite options to consider depending on whether walls were load bearing, and helped me think through where it was good to spend the money vs not.  She helped me to pick tile, granite, cabinet choices etc that gave me the feel I wanted. I really appreciated her help and thought she did a great job.\",\n",

Like with bold, striking patterns and decor. When you're designing your own house though, you can design so it FEELS good, and has the details that you will appreciate as you live there. You can keep tweaking it. It took me forever to get my home office right, but I love it because it feels good to be here. I'm sure a designer would have made different choices.\",\n",

Do you want plenty of natural light or do you work night shift and sleep during the day and need it totally dark. Having a bunch of doors, windows, closets can really limit where you can place things and 800sq feet will shrink pretty fast. You didn't say how many BR/BA you want less than 2 and no master bath unless you want to share with guests (if sharing the placement should be different so people are not walking through your BR to use it). Once you have a room design in terms of space you can do for free what I did. \\n\\nI took graph paper and measured out my rooms to scale, windows, doors etc included. Then I went to a furniture store with it and virtually all have some type of 'designer/decorator' that can then help you find the right size piece and make suggestions on where to put it and maybe find something 'out of the box'. Most actually have software with their own inventory built in and just duplicate your space and start playing with it. In our master for instance, I was able to find what were meant to be dining room cabinets and use them as night tables. Night tables are typically very small, a lamp and alarm clock and you're pretty much done. The dining room pieces were more shallow but longer and had way more storage. I would never have looked at those on my own and they were from the same company, same wood, same design? It cost me nothing to get that advice and worked wonders in terms of a more open floor space though it took a bit more 'wall' space which would have remained unused.\",\n",
