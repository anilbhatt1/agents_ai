When we talk about the ‘[art of renovation](https://www.alpeintureparis.com/2022/08/paris-renovation-art-france.html)’ then we are actually having a lot of terms in our mind. Renovation could be applied to any property, business and apartment. Knowing which type of renovation strategies, colours, material, time duration and budget is required, it is not less than an art. You have to decide about how your interior should look, how your exterior can add maximum worth to your property, how it could be eye- catching, how it could be smooth and relaxing for the family living or for business people to do business in a comfortable situation.\\xa0\\n\\nRenovation art is not so simple that once you have learned it then you will follow those learning during all your lifetime. Rather it is a constant process of learning and updating your skills, equipment, [modelling](https://www.alpeintureparis.com/2022/03/paris-apartment-interior-renovation-painting-france.html) and designing strategies. Fashion, designs, and trends keep on changing every day. So, for a renovating expert it is very necessary to be in touch with the latest developments. Remoulding of already established structures, redesigning of already designed structures requires a certain attention level with latest modern innovations as well as with past experiences.\\xa0 Upgrading your apartments, houses, business and [properties](https://www.alpeintureparis.com/2022/03/paris-apartment-renovation-painting-france.html) in Paris, is always one of the most important desires of the client to add value to their assets. Therefore, you need to acquire a person with careful attention who can update your house up to your desire.\\xa0\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v8c6k2gkjfm91.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1a4a16b033884866c0f08d10c257e06fdf5e5ba5\\n\\nBuildings situated on eye-catching views such as on riverside or with mountain views have their own kind of limitations. You have to follow the municipal codes, and have to design according to its view to make a proper combination of [renovation](https://www.alpeintureparis.com/2022/08/renovation-remodelling-prices-costs.html) skills with those of natural beauty. Often Municipal rules force you to restrict your activities to existing setbacks and structures. So, it becomes very technical to develop any new design remaining in the direction given by the municipality. Similarly there are two further challenges for renovation experts. One is client [budget](https://www.alpeintureparis.com/2021/09/Apartment-Remodel-Cost-Paris-Renovation-Price-Neuilly-Boulogne-Vincennes.html) and 2nd is client demand. That’s why a renovation expert has to discover any idea in which he could find a striking design remaining within the budget and municipal rules.\\n\\n[Renovation](https://www.alpeintureparis.com/2022/08/renovation-remodelling-prices-costs.html) is an art from another perspective as well. As it has to fulfil client desire, while clients are of many tastes. Some want a luxurious look, while some want a contemporary way of life, some give importance to architectural looks while some want simple and economical options. Hence, for different views of people you need diversified options and designs to attract them. Further you must be able to modify those designs according to the taste of the client. Renovation comprises [remodelling](https://www.alpeintureparis.com/2021/09/Remodel-renovation-costs-paris-prices-square-meter.html), add-ons, modifications, reform, preservation and repairing. That’s why renovators have to generate visually stimulating residential remodels featuring light-filled spaces, expansive views, and the most extravagance in the age of modern-day designs. In short, renovation is not just an industry rather it’s an art. Where you have to consider obstacles, dealing with the thought process of people, [budgetary](https://www.alpeintureparis.com/2018/02/renovation-paris-apartment-interior-design-company.html) and administrative obstacles. Dealing with these obstacles you have to emerge with a new innovative and striking idea that can convince your client.\\xa0\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ewf1n6hmjfm91.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0950cf56dca40c3aa9d29e556ecbca9912351bca\\n\\n**MORE RENOVATION TIPS**\\xa0\\n\\n1.

The door is currently a double 36\" french door (pictured below exterior and interior). We are adding a 21\" coat cabinet and boot bench inside the door so we will no longer be able to accomodate the double door. We\\'d love to get 1-2 sidelights around the door but we\\'re not sure if they will fit well. Also note that due to the cabinet inside the door we know the door itself will be offset to the right and \"off center\" with respect to the outer wall. Note that the plans and renderring below show a 42\" door but we decided to go with a 36\" door due to the limited options in fiberglass at 42\".\\n\\n**Question #1: How many sidelights and what size?**\\n\\nThe outer wall is about 89.5\". The current door frame is bookended by 9.5\" returns (depending on how you measure). The new cabinet takes about 21\" of space (depicted by the red line in the interior/exterior pictures. We know the new door will be 36\".\\n\\nHaving trouble with the math on this. From the 89.5\" wall we know we lose 21\" for the cabinet. So, that leaves 68.5\". Take 36\" of that for the door leaves 32.5\". That seems to be enough for at least a 12\"/14\" side light or two 12\" sidelights but I\\'m not sure how much space I need to allow for door jamb, returns, the trim, etc.\\n\\nSo - should we get:\\n\\nA. A 36\" door alone with no sidelights?\\n\\nB. A 36\" door with a single sidelight? If so would 14\" fit? Note that if we get a single sidelight we think we\\'d put it on the right side of the door (from the outside) so that the door is more central on the wall.\\n\\nC. A 36\" door with two sidelights? I think in this case only 12\" sidelights would work.\\n\\n**Question #2: Which way should the door open? (we know it will open inward, so I mean left handed or right handed).**\\n\\nOption 1 - LEFT: As you are facing the house, the door should open in and to the LEFT. Pro: You get a view of our new open floor plan kitchen, front-room, etc. Con: Door can\\'t open all the way and will definetely hit the boot bench. It will open more than 90 deg. but not that much more. Could be a pain for people coming in/out and taking off shoes on the bench.\\n\\nOption 2 - RIGHT: As you are facting the house, the door should open in and to the RIGHT.

Initially I thought of wall mounting a full body mirror there (facing the closet doors) as the spotlight might make for some great lighting but then the floating nightstands won't be symmetrical and I'm not sure if I like that. I don't want to tear it down either as it looks like there's something important there and I would also like to avoid any demo work. I was thinking of maybe hanging some fake plants that start from the other corner of the bed, reaching over to the box in the ceiling as well as back towards the other side of the room. I was also thinking of moving the bed so that it faces the wall with all the posters have one side be pressed directly against the wall but my bed frame actually has drawers on both sides and I would prefer not to lose access to those.

Also this wall will eventually (1+ year from now, maybe 2) be turned into glass windows towards the main living room which is on the other side\\n \\nThat's it for now. I might edit the post later.

If this wasn’t enough, research commissioned by Dulux reveals that as much as 92% of kids say that they would spend more time in the room that they have helped designed themselves.\\xa0\\n\\nKeep scrolling down to know how best can you involve your child in decor of their room.\\n\\n**Using the wall as your canvas**\\n\\nIt’s not the furniture or the bed that\\xa0first\\xa0attracts the attention, it’s the walls! From the paints to artwork to wall\\xa0stickers, these walls of your child’s room are an expression of their thoughts. There is no happier child than the one excitedly talking about how they are going to decorate their walls.\\xa0\\n\\nWalls are to your children what a blank canvas is to a painter- a place to unleash their creativity. There are numerous ways in which the walls can be spruced up.\\n\\n*Ø Painting the wall:*\\xa0Like in everything else, there are different tastes in wall paints as well. There is no need to sweat if your sophisticated, minimalist style clashes with your child's quirky one. There is always a way to reach a consensus. Sit down with the family members and list their color preferences. Take the colors that everyone disagrees on and strike them off the common list. The next step is to finalize the colors that are agreeable to all the members. Once that’s done, let your child choose what they like. This way not only do the children get to have their say, but it also doesn’t interfere with the overall look and symmetry of your home!\\n\\n*Ø Display the artwork:*\\xa0There is no child in the world who doesn’t like to paint and scribble. Another great way to decorate your child’s room is by displaying their artwork on the walls. Let the children decide the wall on which they’ll like their artwork displayed. You could use non-stick adhesive to stick the artwork on the artwork. You could even have pretty little threads crisscrossing on a wall where the kids could hang\\xa0their artwork. Does your child have favorite photographs that are gathering dust in the attic? Time to get those photos out of there and on the walls! \\xa0This is a perfect example of a simple activity being turned into a family bonding time in a fun way.\\n\\n*Ø* [*Wall decals*](https://commomy.com/collections/wall-decals): Wall decals add a lot of excitement and character to your children’s room. Jazzy, wild, offbeat, or conventional, they come in all shapes and sizes for the kids to pick up from. If the kids are slightly older they can even help you install them. Here too, you can jointly decide with the children which corner to decorate the wall with Wall decals.\\xa0\\n\\n**Commomy** has an attractive range of peel and stick decals to decorate the room of your little ones. From [planets in universe ](https://commomy.com/collections/kids-nursery/products/planets-in-universe-peel-and-stick-decals)\\xa0and dinosaur space ship\\xa0peels \\xa0for the little astronauts who want to discover everything about the solar system to [princess and castle](https://commomy.com/collections/kids-nursery/products/princess-and-castle-peel-and-stick-decal)\\xa0and white unicorn peels for your kids who enjoy the delicate things in lives, we have plenty of colorful options to choose from. \\xa0Pick any one of our decals for children and see the ordinary room transformed into their favorite space.\\n\\n**Let them pick their own beds**\\n\\nLetting your child choose their own beds is a fun way to get them involved in the interior decor of their room. The home decor market has a huge segment for children with a wide selection for all age groups. If you have more than one child or there are frequent sleepovers at your place, bunk beds would add a lot of fun. In case you already have the beds, there is still a way to involve your children! Enlist their help in choosing the bedding and change the look of the room\\xa0instantly.\\xa0\\xa0Fairies or horses, unicorns or space ships, solar system, or their favorite cartoon character, the choices are galore when it comes to choosing bedding that your child likes.\\xa0\\xa0📷\\n\\n**Involve them in the actual physical work**\\n\\nNo matter how old your children are, if they have crossed toddlerhood, you can surely give them age-appropriate tasks that go beyond planning. Involving the kids in actual doing of things is a fabulous way of increasing their ownership in their own room and showing what they are capable of. Include\\xa0them in painting the walls or decorating a corner space fills your children with a great sense of pride in their own work.\\xa0\\n\\nAt [**Commomy**](https://commomy.com/)\\xa0we understand that your kids would want to stamp their room with their unique personality. Not just common spaces, we are committed to providing you the best experience when it comes to home decor for your child's room.\\xa0\\n\\n**Commomy**\\xa0offers an array of wall decals to add the fun element to your child's room at affordable prices. We not only care about your walls but our carbon footprints too. All the home decor products including the wall decals are made of high-quality eco-friendly materials. They are also waterproof, and heat resistant. Not just this, they are known for their easy installation too. Since these stickers are removable, repositionable, and reusable, it’s super easy to shift them elsewhere.\\xa0\\n\\nYour home is as much your kids as it is yours. What better way to make the house the reflection of the entire family instead of a few people. Involving kids in planning and the actual decor of the room is not just fulfilling for them but a way to create happy memories full of laughter, joy and **funny**\\xa0moments.\\n\\nLet your child express their creative side with **Commomy**.\", 'Score': 20, 'Total_comments': 4, 'Upvote_ratio': 0.76, 'Post_views': None, 'Post_URL': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/homeimprovementideas/comments/nqk2gi/fun_ideas_to_involve_your_child_in_home_decor/', 'Subreddit': 'homeimprovementideas', 'Subreddit_id': 't5_2w2yb'}, 54: {'Type': 'Post', 'Post_id': '1bzrhax', 'Title': 'I would love constructive critiques of my interior design, please!', 'Author': 'SarahMakesYouStrong', 'Created': '1712667358.0', 'Text': 'We moved into this arts and crafts style home in 2021.

My wife and I moved into this apartment about three years ago, and since we were trying to save money we brought a lot of things we received for free (namely the couches and end tables). We had planned to stick with the furniture until we could move into a bigger house and buy better furniture without having to move it all to the new spot, but turns out buying a home in the US requires a lot more time and money than we originally thought (surprise surprise). We weren\\'t really about our couches before (the big selling point on them is that craigslist gave it to us for zero dollars), but now we\\'re pretty sick of them, and no amount of sprucing (aka couch covers) have really made them any more comfortable or nice looking. We\\'re considering throwing them out and replacing them, so no better time than now for a redesign!\\n\\nSome more information on what we want to use our living room space for:\\n\\nWe\\'re pretty big on having others over to our space, so comfortable and ample seating is crucial. We\\'re open to anything that can both seat a lot of people while also being comfortable enough to sleep on if need be. Funky options like bean bags are also welcome.\\n\\nThe big centerpiece is our 65\" TV. We\\'re not super keen on the TV stand, but the plan is to mount the TV in a future home so it can stay or go.\\n\\nWhen we have people over, the main activities are watching movies, playing video games, playing board games, or just yakkin it up. Depending on the size of the board game, we either use the ottoman, dining room table, or a folding table we keep in the closet.\\n\\nIncluded photos of our setup now (minus some identifying objects), and took measurements of what I thought might be the important dimensions for our floor plan. Ignore the dog toys, and I apologize for the mix of feet/inches in my measurements. Thank you to anyone who reads all this and helps us out!\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5d46jma3367d1.jpg?width=1958&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2d3a5fa9674f1ae9e41ebf3f372d156061f5c116\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d4e1vla3367d1.jpg?width=1882&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=483e3699791caed738951620e4d34406630138d3\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4xxyrna3367d1.jpg?width=1844&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fa9ddefd55dddae9d8ddece16c9ea924fdb082f2\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xiwjkna3367d1.jpg?width=1924&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ae9063f3a7453e9454eb5377dd1037aae19ccaa1\\n\\n[Should be 11\\'9\\\\\\\\\" and 7\\'21\\\\\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/ie69rqa3367d1.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d0dbc328bf8177438a8f9374c12f93d57bddbd72)\\n\\n', 'Score': 1, 'Total_comments': 0, 'Upvote_ratio': 1.0, 'Post_views': None, 'Post_URL': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/DesignMyRoom/comments/1di3xfx/help_redesign_our_living_room/', 'Subreddit': 'DesignMyRoom', 'Subreddit_id': 't5_2ux9b'}, 82: {'Type': 'Post', 'Post_id': 'nwmmjc', 'Title': 'Help redesign my living room please!', 'Author': 'Katbiird', 'Created': '1623328815.0', 'Text': '', 'Score': 280, 'Total_comments': 56, 'Upvote_ratio': 0.98, 'Post_views': None, 'Post_URL': 'https://www.reddit.com/gallery/nwmmjc', 'Subreddit': 'DesignMyRoom', 'Subreddit_id': 't5_2ux9b'}, 83: {'Type': 'Post', 'Post_id': '1dedg3n', 'Title': 'Need help redesigning my room', 'Author': 'EmergencyAd9381', 'Created': '1718216131.0', 'Text': 'Looks like a teenagers room and needs to be redesigned', 'Score': 1, 'Total_comments': 4, 'Upvote_ratio': 0.67, 'Post_views': None, 'Post_URL': 'https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1dedg3n', 'Subreddit': 'DesignMyRoom', 'Subreddit_id': 't5_2ux9b'}, 84: {'Type': 'Post', 'Post_id': '1c5cy31', 'Title': 'Completely redesign living room', 'Author': 'Weary-Appearance1456', 'Created': '1713264165.0', 'Text': 'I hate it.', 'Score': 1, 'Total_comments': 1, 'Upvote_ratio': 1.0, 'Post_views': None, 'Post_URL': 'https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1c5cy31', 'Subreddit': 'DesignMyRoom', 'Subreddit_id': 't5_2ux9b'}, 85: {'Type': 'Post', 'Post_id': '1cvpbo9', 'Title': 'Help me redesign my room!', 'Author': 'sappolo_sash', 'Created': '1716128339.0', 'Text': 'Looking for advice on how to make the best out this small bedroom.

This is the first room you see when you enter, and I really want it to have a \"wow\" factor. Money is no obstacle, so I\\'m open to all suggestions, from furniture to decor pieces.\\n\\nHere are some specifics I\\'m considering:\\n\\n* **Color Scheme:** I\\'m drawn to a palette of brown, black, white, and green. I think these colors can create a sophisticated yet welcoming atmosphere.\\n* **Plants:** I\\'m okay with incorporating fake plants to add some life and color, considering the ease of maintenance and the safety for my 2-year-old.\\n* **Child Safety:** Speaking of the little one, it\\'s crucial that the room is safe for a toddler. So, I\\'m looking for decor ideas that are both stunning and child-friendly.\\n* **Style Influence:** The exterior of our home is Spanish Colonial, and while I want the interior to complement this style, I\\'m also open to modern touches that can seamlessly blend with the overall aesthetic.\\n\\nI want to create a space that\\'s not only visually appealing but also functional for our family\\'s daily life. If anyone has suggestions on decor pieces, furniture layouts, or even specific brands or artists to look at, I\\'d greatly appreciate it.\\n\\nAdditionally, I\\'m curious if anyone has experience with using AI platforms for interior design planning.

Our home was built by Mill workers about 100 year ago. We love it, but it certainly has it’s quirks. We don’t need help with colors - more so styles of furniture and layouts. So something like “3 seater sofa” would suffice and we feel confident coordinating the colors.\\n\\nCurrently our living room has a sectional that has to go, it sticks out straight in front of the main entrance. The TV is above the fireplace mantle and not able to be centered with the sectional because of where the mantle is located and how to doorways are arranged.\\n\\nWe are hoping to move our record player, collection, and speakers into the living room somehow but would be fine if it had to stay in the dining room. Worth mentioning the tables the record player sits on is where our collection currently is.\\n\\nWe’ve played around with two ideas:\\n\\n1. Replacing the sectional with a 3 seater sofa that fits wore comfortably/naturally between the room entrances, leaving the TV where it is. Then replacing the love seat with our record collection and surrounding it with two chairs that match the space.\\n2. Splitting the room. Moving the TV to the wall nearest the front door and having a 3 seater in the center of the room near the fire place. Then placing the record tables and collection on the back of the sofa with chairs or another sofa on the back wall. (My wife is NOT pleased with this idea however)\\n\\nWe are open to absolutely any ideas or advice at all and not sold on the two we've talked about. We are willing to part with all of our current furniture if necessary, as well! We’re at our wits end with this and really do appreciate any input and even just you taking the time to read through this.

Interior design is the art and science of understanding people’s behavior to create functional spaces within a building, while interior decorating is the furnishing or adorning of a space with decorative elements to achieve a certain aesthetic. **Interior designers may decorate, but decorators do not design.** \\n\\nThe interior design process follows a systematic and coordinated methodology—including research, analysis and integration of knowledge into the creative process—to satisfy the needs and resources of the client. Designers must respond to and coordinate with the building shell and acknowledge the physical location and social context of the project. \\n\\nDesigners can be found in both the residential and commercial industries, and often work hand in hand with architects. They focus on life safety, code adherence, ADA accessibility, sustainability, fire safety, and air quality. \\n\\nBecause of the complexity of their role, interior designers are generally expected to achieve a higher level of education than interior decorators, who require no formal training or licensure. Many designers sit for the NCIDQ which allows them to become registered. This is a series of 3 tests that can only be taken after achieving years of experience under the guidance of an NCIDQ registered supervisor.\\n\\nTo understand how difficult the tests are, here are some of the questions:\\n\\n1. What documentation protects your client if the contractor, who is awarded a job through a formal process, is unable to commence work? A) Bid Bond B) Arbitration Clause C) Performance Bond or D) Certificate of Liability Insurance\\n\\n2. Which flooring test provides the best measure of slip resistance? A) ASTM F1677 B) ASTM D2047 C) ASTM F1679 or D) ASTM C1028\\n\\n3. Which of the following tests is MOST important to review for performance when you are specifying the porcelain tile on a ramp surface? A) ASTM Radiant Panel Test B) ASTM Coefficient of Friction Test C) California Technical Bulletin #117 or D) California Technical Bulletin #133\\n\\nMy hope for the future is that our industry requires anyone using the \"Interior Designer\" title to be registered akin to the architecture profession. It is illegal in the United States to use the title \"Architect\" unless you have passed the ARE and become registered. Changing the laws to reflect this for interior designers would restore a level of professionalism to designers and allow them to be paid according to their status.', 'Score': 311, 'Total_comments': 43, 'Upvote_ratio': 0.95, 'Post_views': None, 'Post_URL': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/InteriorDesign/comments/11bpith/interior_decorators_vs_interior_designers/', 'Subreddit': 'InteriorDesign', 'Subreddit_id': 't5_2r5qs'}, 424: {'Type': 'Post', 'Post_id': '1627ecr', 'Title': 'Need help redesigning 80s mansion room!', 'Author': '5000mg', 'Created': '1693085622.0', 'Text': 'Hi guys!

Our home was built by Mill workers about 100 year ago. We love it, but it certainly has it’s quirks. We don’t need help with colors - more so styles of furniture and layouts. So something like “3 seater sofa” would suffice and we feel confident coordinating the colors.  \\n  \\nCurrently our living room has a sectional that has to go, it sticks out straight in front of the main entrance. The TV is above the fireplace mantle and not able to be centered with the sectional because of where the mantle is located and how to doorways are arranged.  \\n  \\nWe are hoping to move our record player, collection, and speakers into the living room somehow but would be fine if it had to stay in the dining room. Worth mentioning the tables the record player sits on is where our collection currently is.  \\n  \\nWe’ve played around with two ideas:  \\n  \\n1) Replacing the sectional with a 3 seater sofa that fits wore comfortably/naturally between the room entrances, leaving the TV where it is. Then replacing the love seat with our record collection and surrounding it with two chairs that match the space.  \\n  \\n2) Splitting the room. Moving the TV to the wall nearest the front door and having a 3 seater in the center of the room near the fire place. Then placing the record tables and collection on the back of the sofa with chairs or another sofa on the back wall. (My wife is NOT pleased with this idea however)  \\n  \\nWe are open to absolutely any ideas or advice at all and not sold on the two we've talked about. We are willing to part with all of our current furniture if necessary, as well!

I use this flat when working in town and occasionally I can host up to 2 more people in the sofa-bed when needed, but that\\'s about it (it pretty much becomes a camp at that point) .\\n\\nI\\'m trying to optimize space and not make it feel cramped or look messy, but the available space is what it is and I\\'m no designer, nor I know the main criteria to look for when arranging furniture. Currently the apartment is arranged like in the 1st sketch below (yes, there is a single bed just \"there\"). I mainly work in the top left corner where I have my desktop, the radiator on my side, AC on my back and easy access and view to the TV and the window. That wall is exactly 96.5 cm wide, and I\\'m using a 95 cm table, which isn\\'t much for a desktop, but couldn\\'t think of a better spot. There isn\\'t much to say about the kitchen corner, but the kitchen table is a bit crammed in there. \\n\\n[Current arrangement](https://preview.redd.it/cau6tg68voxc1.png?width=3781&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d421c0c0b32f06d7589a3900d42865387fc813c)\\n\\nMy main issues at the moment are:\\n\\n1. The sofa is too far away from the TV (I also drew a dashed line to show how much it\\'d occupy when opened into a bed, even if that\\'s only needed maybe 3 times a year for a week)\\n2. The bed is just laying there and is not a nice first sight as you come in the apt, but I don\\'t know where to put it.\\n3. I have some boat models that I would like to put on display, but I wouldn\\'t know where to place them, and so they\\'re just resting in the basement (ideally I\\'d like to look at them and not have them hidden in some obscure wall)\\n\\nThe only solutions I could come up with were:\\n\\n1. Put the sofa closer to the TV and hide the bed behind it (or is that a barbaric arrangement?)\\n2. Get rid of the bed and buy one of those \"bed in closet\" units, so that I can just hide the bed away in the closet during the day and gain more space\\n3. If going with option 2), then I could put the displays behind the sofa (or put something else) and even move the kitchen table more in the middle of the room. (Another option is putting the display unit in front of the desktop, so I can look at them all the time).\\n\\nI don\\'t know how to use those fancy softwares so I just did some rough sketches on ppt (I put a scalebar at the top right). I can share the ppt if you want to shuffle stuff (it\\'s scaled 1:20). Can you give me some ideas?

Many of the videos I saw recommended making optical dividers to separate the bed from the rest of the area, or separate the entry way from the rest of the studio.  So I could put it vertical against the end of the bed. But it just seems like such a big piece for a small space at 90cm x 270cm x 30cm. If I put it horizontal against another wall, I am thinking I can put fold up cabinet doors on this shelf to double as a desk, fold it down when not in use.

The ability of granite to make a significant addition to the style and sophistication of a home lies in its exquisite colors. This is the major reason why so many discriminating homeowners always choose granite for their building projects.\\n\\nThese granite colors can be grouped into two general classifications: the neutral granite colors and the darker granite colors. Basically, the utilization of the neutral shades of granite is quite different with that of granite with darker colors. Although it is possible to mix and match these colors, design consideration requires us to follow the normal pattern of things to achieve harmony in our over-all decor.\\n\\nHaving stated that, here are the different granite colors and their usual applications. This will help you choose your granite if you are building a kitchen counter, a bathroom counter, a vanity top or similar fixtures in your home.\\n\\nGranite's Lighter Colors\\nLight colored granites are very flexible and can be used in different applications.\\n\\n• Beige - when it comes to decoration, this color of granite offers more flexibility. This color ranges from light to dark beige.\\n\\n• White - this color is best if you want a simple, refined and sophisticated look in your room. White granites are very appropriate for modern homes.\\n\\n• Gray - gray colored granite is best in highlighting a simple setting and lending support to a focal point in the room. It also goes well with light cabinetry and glass.\\n\\n• Yellow - this granite color is very popular. It will brighten up a room and give it a sunny and warm ambience.\\n\\nGranite's Darker Shades\\nIf you really want to make your room very special, it is best to use granite with darker colors.\\n\\n• Green - granite with this color will make your room very extraordinary. With its varying colors of green, it will give your room variety and spontaneity.\\n\\n• Gold - this color of granite will really make your room look rich and luxurious. This type of granite is a best-seller in the United States. It can also blend will with almost any decor in your room.\\n\\n• Brown - this is the most widely available color. It goes well with wood cabinetry with light color. If you want a classical look in the room, brown granite is the best.\\n\\n• Black - this is the best color that will give your kitchen that modern look, especially if you will install cabinetry with clean, straight lines.\\n\\n• Red - red colored stone exudes excitement and romance. It is the oldest used granite in history, being present in Egyptian pyramids. This granite is best for decorative functions.\\n\\n• Blue - this color is also popular with modern designers. They prefer this granite because of its gorgeous vein patterns.\\n\\n• Burgundy - this color looks like red granite but is as versatile as brown granite. It will look best in kitchen countertops and can blend well with stainless steel kitchen appliances.\\n\\nSo think about the above when choosing granite counter-tops colors.\", 'Score': 1, 'Total_comments': 0, 'Upvote_ratio': 0.67, 'Post_views': None, 'Post_URL': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/interior_design/comments/6k6k5m/the_exquisite_colors_of_granite_rajexim/', 'Subreddit': 'interior_design', 'Subreddit_id': 't5_2r9zm'}, 542: {'Type': 'Post', 'Post_id': '5aqnja', 'Title': 'Hiring a designer, what to expect, what stage to hire in?', 'Author': 'CMSigner', 'Created': '1478101844.0', 'Text': \"Hi all!\\n\\nThanks in advance for helping me with making some of these decisions.\\n\\nMy partner and I closed on a [630 sqft condo](http://imgur.com/a/qBlne).

(Choosing flooring, paint colors, figuring out what type of items I need to be looking for--clear or opaque chairs/solid or pattern rugs, type of bar stools, type of couch, etc.) \\n* **Would it be better to get my items into the condo before having a designer come by?** Should I just take pictures of my current items and give them to a designer? '\\n* **Am I in an awkward stage to hire someone and should wait until I'm ready to drop a few/several grand?** I'm in the mindset that I would like to not be purchasing items that won't be heading in the right direction and talking to a designer might help me know what will work best. \\n\\n\\nI can post items of my own if that helps or if anyone wants to give suggestions on what might work with the room. \\nWe really need to keep our current bedroom set (Nice cherry furniture).

The only really weird things I would love a designer to work around for us is seeing if we can fit a mexican hammock hanging area somewhere and adding any storage we can without making the room bulky--obviously we need the place to look as big as it can look. \\n\\n\\nAnd, lastly: **How can I be a good client for a designer and how can I prepare for meetings with the designer to make the most of my time if I am in a good spot to hire now.**\\n\\nPlease let me know if my mindset is off or if I don't sound like I would be a good candidate for a designer right now. \", 'Score': 7, 'Total_comments': 7, 'Upvote_ratio': 1.0, 'Post_views': None, 'Post_URL': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/interior_design/comments/5aqnja/hiring_a_designer_what_to_expect_what_stage_to/', 'Subreddit': 'interior_design', 'Subreddit_id': 't5_2r9zm'}, 543: {'Type': 'Post', 'Post_id': '7xpgxh', 'Title': 'Natural Stone a Perfect Solution for Your Interior Design Needs', 'Author': 'rsgstones', 'Created': '1518689804.0', 'Text': 'Natural stone is found almost everywhere in the world. It is mined from the grounds and the mountains. These quarried pieces of stone are then used for architectural and interior design purposes. India has a variety of natural stones. These vary in colour and grades depending upon the constituent minerals found in the geographical locality. Some examples of natural stone found in India include granite, marble, sandstone, limestone etc. aesthetics. Natural stones, in general, are available in slabs or tiles. They can be customised so that they fit any size, therefore reducing leftovers and saving up on budget spends.\\n\\nInterior design is an imperative part of any space. Whether consciously thought upon or otherwise, the look, feel, texture, lighting etc. will directly affect one’s experience of it. Increasingly nowadays, people are getting more and more involved in the layout of their homes, the material choices, colour schemes and more. Especially when it comes to common spaces in the home like the living room and the kitchen, the layout as well as the look and feel needs a good amount of contribution from the end users of the space. \\n\\nKitchens are a perfect example for the phrase - ‘form follows function’. This means that the layout of the kitchen should be indicative of the end usage of the place. The layout and the material selection must be carefully thought of here. Layout must be adapted to the given space. Materials that are easy to clean and age well are ideal for use in the kitchen.  [Best kitchen countertops](http://www.rsgstones.com/) are those that are durable as well as aesthetically good looking.  Natural stones are the perfect examples of such materials. They come in a variety of colours ranging from greys to pinks, greens and browns. Stone slabs can also be cut to fit in according to the place available. They require little to no maintenance and age beautifully. Materials like granite, marble and sandstone slabs are popularly used in kitchens depending upon available budgets as well as the aesthetical style. \\n\\nSandstone is another popular example of using stone for architectural and interior design purposes. Indian sandstone is commonly revered for its grand aesthetics. It comes in a variety of rich, earthy tones that match perfectly with a variety of visual styles. [Indian sandstone paving slabs](http://www.rsgstones.com/ProductDetails/7/yes) are available in soft tones of beige, brown, mauve, grey and rose. They can be cut into a range of sizes to best suit the end usage. This stone is formed millions of years ago under very high temperatures which cause tiny veins of colour from naturally occurring pigments. Due to the high concentration of quartz in its formation, the stone is really tough and strong, making it the perfect choice for flooring. Similarly, slate tile flooring is also known for its easy maintenance and high durability. This stone is also available in a range of colours.

No matter the lifestyle, kitchens are usually the most used room of any house. Kitchens are where children grow up, conversations happen over meal preparation and where family comes together. The convenience in terms of layout and materials must be the first preference. In this space indeed, form must follow function.  A comfortable kitchen that is brightly lit serves to increase the perception of any space as well as provide inspiration to a task that must be  carried out on a regular basis – cooking. An effective way of brightening up a kitchen is by using light coloured surfaces and facades that bounce off natural or artificial light falling upon it.

Marble is a stone that has always been viewed as a grand and classic choice and when it comes to a lighter shade, the stone lends a subtly luxurious aesthetic quality. Marble is a stone that is heat resistant and chip and crack resistant, making it the ideal choice as a countertop material. Marble platforms tend to age well and are almost immune to wear and tear. Acidic materials are advised to be kept away from it in order to avoid permanently staining the white surface. Although the material asks for moderate to high maintenance, it is quite worth the effort for a long lasting luxurious space.\\n\\nFor a more economical option for the above, a similar natural stone - granite might be used. White granite countertops lend a similar classical look to marble but tend to be easier to maintain. Granite is an igneous rock constituting compressed grains of Mica, Quartz and other minerals making it highly durable. They are best suited for high usage, low maintenance kitchens and bathrooms. \\n\\nAnother example of a classically beautiful usage of natural stone in interior design is slate. Aesthetically, slate is known to raise the overall value of the property due to the stone’s classy texture and appearance. [Slate tile flooring](http://www.rsgstones.com/ProductDetails/9/yes) is naturally slip and stain resistant. It is available in a variety of colours and can be chosen as solid coloured tiles, multicolour tiles or a combination of the two. The grouting between the tiles is an essential part of the installation process and the same can be chosen in a variety of colours too.\\n', 'Score': 2, 'Total_comments': 0, 'Upvote_ratio': 1.0, 'Post_views': None, 'Post_URL': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/interior_design/comments/7se141/classical_interior_design_ideas_and_their/', 'Subreddit': 'interior_design', 'Subreddit_id': 't5_2r9zm'}, 545: {'Type': 'Post', 'Post_id': '5g484f', 'Title': 'https://modernvintagerugs.com/blog/rugs-and-carpets/modern-rugs-how-to-style-them.html', 'Author': 'ruglove', 'Created': '1480696834.0', 'Text': 'Cool picture ideas for decorating your room with modern rugs.

I’m having some conflicts with her regarding her fees and vastly going over my budget. I know renovation projects typically go over budget. However, I want to see if what she is doing falls under normal or if I’m getting fleeced. \\n\\nWhen I first interviewed the designer, I told her my budget ($50k) and that I was concerned about her fees as she is hourly. In contrast, other designers I interviewed were flat rate. She said she would work with me and keep her hours low, though no specifics were mentioned. She doesn’t use contracts and instead asks for upfront payment to cover her first 20 hours.\\n\\nAfter choosing materials and coming up with a general design for everything, we review her estimate for the materials and contractors, which is a little over my budget, but within reason. On the estimate, she also lists a “Designer Fee” under each contractor equal to 10% of the contractor charge, adding up to about $3k. No other payments or fees were discussed, I approved the estimate, and I wrote her a check to cover the purchase of the materials at this point.\\n\\nAbout a month later, after all the materials had been ordered and the actual construction work had started, she gave me two invoices. The first is a revised version of the first estimate, but now her designer fees have tripled to almost $9k. The additional invoice is for her hourly fee and is 4x the amount I paid her initially. In total, all of her costs are now $20k, 40% of my original budget.\\n\\nHer explanation for the “Designer Fee” on the estimate is that it covers her time working with contractors off-site and that the other invoice is for her hours spent with me, shopping, and on-site with contractors. She doesn’t keep track of her off-site hours, so she “plays around with the numbers” based on the contractor bids until she comes up with a number that she thinks “is fair to her.”\\n\\nShe also said that her on-site hours were lower than they usually are for her previous clients, but she needed to spend that time on-site with the contractors to make sure everything was going as planned, essentially acting as a project manager. \\n\\nWhen I asked why she took the job when the budget was only $50k, and she knows how much her fees usually add up, she replied that she assumed the budget I gave her was just for the renovation and did not include her fees. This is “normal,” according to her. She also assumed that my budget was expanding because I decided I wanted to “splurge” on a couple of expensive fixtures.\\n\\nFor those of you who have used interior designers before, is what’s happening to me normal business practice?

It's a large, L shaped room with a fireplace that serves as a family/play/movie room.

I've added a couple of sconces in the rear. \\n\\nI plan to do a complete revamp of this room. It will likely take a while since I will do most of it myself. I've been slowly formulating the design in my head for a while, and I think I have enough there to get critiqued:\\n\\n* Color: Even though this is a dark room, I plan to go with a dark wall color, SW Cyberspace. I think this will give the room a warm cozy feel, especially when paired with planned dark wood trim and warm, 2700k lighting.\\n\\n* Trim: I want to use white 4 inch craftsman style trim for the baseboards and 3 inch around doors and the window. The half wall along the edge under the window will be capped with dark stained poplar. I could also use this wood for any shelving I add later. I think this stain will pair very well with the wall color. It's General Finishes brown mahogany, to be specific. \\n\\n* Lighting/Ceiling: This is where things get tricky for me. I want to add lighting, but don't want your standard recessed can style lighting across the ceiling. Would like indirect if possible. So at first, I thought adding a shallow tray ceiling with hidden strip lights and small recessed lights around the edge would look nice, [like this](https://finishedbasementsandmore.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/lighting-ceiling-basement.jpg). I still really like this look, but am not sure if I want to lower parts of the ceiling any more since they're already 8 ft. Maybe I could still do the small recessed lights around the perimeter without the tray ceiling. Additionally, I plan to replace the small track light with something larger.\\n\\n* Fireplace: The fireplace would be updated drastically. I'd like a gas insert instead of the useless wood burner, and would do stone or tile to the ceiling.\\n\\n* Future Built-In: This is a long term want, but I'd like to add built ins around the fireplace. They would have their own lighting, and would be designed to hold all the TV system components.\\n\\n\\nSo, how does this look?

MY EXTERIOR WALL IS LIVE WITH ELECTRICITY!!!', 'Author': 'ms9pop00', 'Created': '1647260649.0', 'Text': \"UPDATE:\\n\\nI ignored most people on here and didn't call anyone, and broke out my voltage meter. I figured out it was in fact the outlets on the interior of my house that were feeding juice to the wall. My volt meter was reading 110 volts from the wall to the ground, but only if the wall was wet. It would read basically 0 on a dry wall. With that breaker off, it dropped to 0 wet or not. \\n\\nPulled the 4 outlets on that circuit out of the wall. My house is old enough that every room used to have switches for the outlets to power lamps when you walked into a room. I don't even know that the switch for these outlets still exits in my home because I've never found it. But the wiring between the outlets for a switch was still there. Had, white, black, and RED wiring running from each outlet. Went through disconnecting outlets one by one. Ending up doing a test and leaving black and white hot wires attached and disconnecting anything red. Boom issue fixed. All the outlets work, and no juice to the exterior wall. Capped any red wiring that was left to be safe and put it all back together. Double checked with a tester and voltage is only where its supposed to be now.\\n\\nDo I think people should play around with electrical, of course not. But am I glad I at least tried to diagnose this myself, absolutely. At a minimum I could have exhausted my safe options I could handle before I call someone out to pay $100 and skip to the stuff I can't do. \\n\\nTLDR: Got lucky and they must have put a staple into a line for an old switch that was no longer needed.

Same if I just touch the water.\\n\\nI went inside and traced the pipe in the basement and no wires are near it where it could be grounding out.

So right now there really is only patio furniture (which I will move outside when the painters come) and a new TV in it. The kitchen and bathroom are fully stocked but everything is in cabinets. Other then that - place is basically empty. My original thought was to just stay out of the house for the 3 days it takes them to paint and maybe stop by on work breaks to look at the progress since I'm so close. I can also run down since I'm so close at work.

It reminds me of the Golden Gate Bridge and the SF fog.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6jbw4ga5aaec1.png?width=5312&format=png&auto=webp&s=9acd50a804ae137454656ab71b1f74f3d98e9913\\n\\nThe seating arrangement of the living room is very conversation-friendly. The side chairs are a great pick and look light enough for guests to pull forward!\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0d8qf5k6aaec1.png?width=5655&format=png&auto=webp&s=b175c2ec42dc2cb28479fe377c2adc2f77303090\\n\\nThe existing layout is the best way it can be used; the living room and the dining room should never be flipped here. The current layout creates paths of travel between the dining and living areas to give it just enough separation.\\n\\nThe rug usage here is also great, which is normally quite difficult, especially in an open layout. Too big or running all the way to the dining room would make the entire space feel too small.\\n\\n**Designer Recommendations**\\n\\n*Display shelving and styling*\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dlonxxa9aaec1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=614bdc3a4f6e7ee35a032d7956eec8b3e93f0869\\n\\nBecause AJ has so many decor pieces, having glass display domes would make the items feel more sophisticated and luxurious.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b7mg55zbaaec1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=14970044e771d064053f31f68f001bc8efdf7050\\n\\nGlass display domes with black bases play off the black staircase and gives a mix of both contemporary and traditional styles. You only need to get 4 or 5 of these and can do it for as little as $200.\\n\\n*Window treatment and blinds*\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a8en170eaaec1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4cf34a307a0c6c11a24e680afd36fa05394eccb5\\n\\nWith the high pitched ceiling and hardwood, you should use fabrics and soft materials to help with acoustics. Velvet or fabric furniture pieces are great choices here!\\n\\nSF homes are typically perched above the ground floor and get a lot of shade and privacy from trees so you don’t always need window treatment. But here, I think adding some treatment can help with both the acoustics and add a sense of comfort.\\n\\nI rarely go with dark window treatments, but because these will be pulled up at least 90% of the time, I’m going bold and suggesting dark patterned ones!\\n\\n*Fireplace refinishing*\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7uspcyffaaec1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a96f2490ed7c9774dcc981a26efac6e58c6bb975\\n\\nThe mantle here HAS to go.

It reminds me of the Golden Gate Bridge and the SF fog.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6jbw4ga5aaec1.png?width=5312&format=png&auto=webp&s=9acd50a804ae137454656ab71b1f74f3d98e9913\\n\\nThe seating arrangement of the living room is very conversation-friendly. The side chairs are a great pick and look light enough for guests to pull forward!\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0d8qf5k6aaec1.png?width=5655&format=png&auto=webp&s=b175c2ec42dc2cb28479fe377c2adc2f77303090\\n\\nThe existing layout is the best way it can be used; the living room and the dining room should never be flipped here. The current layout creates paths of travel between the dining and living areas to give it just enough separation.\\n\\nThe rug usage here is also great, which is normally quite difficult, especially in an open layout. Too big or running all the way to the dining room would make the entire space feel too small.\\n\\n**Designer Recommendations**\\n\\n*Display shelving and styling*\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dlonxxa9aaec1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=614bdc3a4f6e7ee35a032d7956eec8b3e93f0869\\n\\nBecause AJ has so many decor pieces, having glass display domes would make the items feel more sophisticated and luxurious.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b7mg55zbaaec1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=14970044e771d064053f31f68f001bc8efdf7050\\n\\nGlass display domes with black bases play off the black staircase and gives a mix of both contemporary and traditional styles. You only need to get 4 or 5 of these and can do it for as little as $200.\\n\\n*Window treatment and blinds*\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a8en170eaaec1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4cf34a307a0c6c11a24e680afd36fa05394eccb5\\n\\nWith the high pitched ceiling and hardwood, you should use fabrics and soft materials to help with acoustics. Velvet or fabric furniture pieces are great choices here!\\n\\nSF homes are typically perched above the ground floor and get a lot of shade and privacy from trees so you don’t always need window treatment. But here, I think adding some treatment can help with both the acoustics and add a sense of comfort.\\n\\nI rarely go with dark window treatments, but because these will be pulled up at least 90% of the time, I’m going bold and suggesting dark patterned ones!\\n\\n*Fireplace refinishing*\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7uspcyffaaec1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a96f2490ed7c9774dcc981a26efac6e58c6bb975\\n\\nThe mantle here HAS to go. The shelves are already recessed but the heavy mantle breaks all of the smoothness and juts out. While you’re getting rid of the mantle, mount the TV flush to the wall!\\n\\nI want to (urgently, like today) paint the fireplace section an off black color. This will immediately counter play with the spiral staircase and balance the living room and the open dining/entry space.\\n\\nThe exact finish I would do is from Portola Paints. Just the finish itself “black roman clay” speaks to the soul and spirit of the space.\\n\\n\\\\-\\n\\nAnd that's the end of my blog post!

Since my partner does not work from home anymore, I don't need that large of a desk. I am thinking of getting a height-adjustable one instead, at most 120cm wide.\\n- Our dog sleeps in the covered dog crate in the office. Admittedly, the crate is huge for the size of our dog. I'm thinking to get a smaller crate and safe some space.\\n- I have an ikea shelve that I would love to place in the office. It currently awkwardly occupies a corner on our bed room.\\n- I don't like the gray wall. I would love to get some color into the room, maybe some green to match the shelve and the plants. But what kind of green? Dark and rich or rather pastel?\\n- Maybe I should replace the cheap carpet for something matching a common color scheme, if there is any? \\n- The whiteboard hanging on the wall can pop open to serve as a standing desk. (built that thing myself) although I generally like it, I'm not married to it. I don't like how deep it is (extends ~15cm from the wall). Assuming I get a height adjustable table, I'd probably hang a proper low profile white board instead. \\n- Making things fit can be rather awkward in this small space.

My question is about living room - as you see where the work table is - the sun is shining to the monitor from the balcony windows (south side) and it's not very comfortable. So I need to cover that window, maybe the curtains there will work too. But i'm wondering how the living room would look like if the curtains would be only on balcony windows - that two windows on the right would be bare without any cover - the sun is not the problem there, because it's a west side.

You can turn even a small balcony into a cosy room with a catchy style and personal touch. Read on and discover the top 3 balcony design ideas and how to start your new renovation project.\\n\\nFirst things first, it is critical to decide what you are going to transform your balcony into. Here are the most popular ideas.\\n\\n**Idea #1 – Recreational space**\\n\\nWhy not put a small armchair or a beanbag on your balcony? Then, make a trendy vertical gardening decor to create a natural ambience. These two ideas alone will create a cosy recreational space to relax during the day. For vertical gardens, just put plants, herbs, or grass into the pots and mount them on a wall or light shelving.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lsvh5s37i9q81.jpg?width=4131&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=65ff5a46eeb3d849c450ad9c99639e32bd1ae793\\n\\nIf you have some extra space, fill it with a small tea table and books you always wanted to read. Another option is a folding table that you can place under the window, a genuine game-changer for narrow balconies.\\n\\nIn addition, do not neglect curtains or blackout blinds to use them at night and on sunny days.\\n\\nPeople use an extremely wide variety of finishing materials for their balconies, from bricks to laminate. However, it is critical to use heat-resistant materials if a balcony experiences high temperature extremes. Many don't have underfloor heating, so an easy tip here is to use a cosy rug to keep your feet warm.\\n\\n**Idea #2 – Home office**\\n\\nRemote work and flexible conditions have seen a sharp upward trend since the pandemic, so having a home office is almost a must nowadays. If your balcony has enough space, why not turn it into a flexible workspace? It will have plenty of natural light, while soundproof windows will secure no distractions.\\n\\nEach balcony is different, as well as the needs of homeowners. That is why you need to design your own layout, making sure that you have enough room for a desk, chair, and something else to store your documents or anything you need for work. One of the vital tips here is to have your balcony waterproofed and insulated because you will have electrical gadgets there.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6ylwfsf8i9q81.jpg?width=3247&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6129a2fcf745424c65313cf15e47c927184c466e\\n\\nMany designers suggest going for minimalism to create the right and satisfying working atmosphere without distractions to have productive days.\\n\\n**Idea #3 – Storage room**\\n\\nThe last idea might seem dull from first sight, but you can apply a creative approach and personal touch to even a simple storage room. Many homeowners have no other place to store the things they need, so the balcony becomes the only option.\\n\\nHowever, there are several tips to make your storage area a creative space. For instance, consider a built-in cupboard that eliminates visual noise and provide convenient storage. Another idea is to get low cabinets and place something soft (like pillows and plaids) on top. This way, you will have a lot of storage and cosy recreational space, all in one.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4z1jx269i9q81.jpg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b22d13cdee315a086c1b55f9fd9a4286bdb1678b\\n\\nOnce you have an idea for your balcony renovation, you can start making sketches or simple drawings. Most interior designers use professional software for their clients, but there are several other options available for those who want to do everything by themselves to save money and create a personal touch. Many new and amateur designers use user-friendly online software and create their own design projects in apps like Planner5d or roomplanner. You can choose whichever you find and start your own journey.\\n\\nHope these simple tips and ideas will inspire and help you transform your balcony into a catchy new space.\", 'Score': 5, 'Total_comments': 1, 'Upvote_ratio': 1.0, 'Post_views': None, 'Post_URL': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmateurInteriorDesign/comments/tqt01r/the_top_3_balcony_design_ideas/', 'Subreddit': 'AmateurInteriorDesign', 'Subreddit_id': 't5_62lve8'}, 847: {'Type': 'Post', 'Post_id': '13uokne', 'Title': 'Top 7 AI interior design tools so far in 2023', 'Author': 'andrew_cherniy96', 'Created': '1685347486.0', 'Text': 'https://preview.redd.it/sitramearr2b1.jpg?width=1430&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=80ef7cc50a10e7e4b3583eb4d49ba05543cb495e\\n\\nSeven Top AI interior design tools in 2023:\\n\\n1.

Many don't have underfloor heating, so an easy tip here is to use a cosy rug to keep your feet warm.\\n\\n**Idea #2 – Home office**\\n\\nRemote work and flexible conditions have seen a sharp upward trend since the pandemic, so having a home office is almost a must nowadays. If your balcony has enough space, why not turn it into a flexible workspace? It will have plenty of natural light, while soundproof windows will secure no distractions.\\n\\nEach balcony is different, as well as the needs of homeowners. That is why you need to design your own layout, making sure that you have enough room for a desk, chair, and something else to store your documents or anything you need for work. One of the vital tips here is to have your balcony waterproofed and insulated because you will have electrical gadgets there.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6ylwfsf8i9q81.jpg?width=3247&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6129a2fcf745424c65313cf15e47c927184c466e\\n\\nMany designers suggest going for minimalism to create the right and satisfying working atmosphere without distractions to have productive days.\\n\\n**Idea #3 – Storage room**\\n\\nThe last idea might seem dull from first sight, but you can apply a creative approach and personal touch to even a simple storage room. Many homeowners have no other place to store the things they need, so the balcony becomes the only option.\\n\\nHowever, there are several tips to make your storage area a creative space. For instance, consider a built-in cupboard that eliminates visual noise and provide convenient storage. Another idea is to get low cabinets and place something soft (like pillows and plaids) on top. This way, you will have a lot of storage and cosy recreational space, all in one.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4z1jx269i9q81.jpg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b22d13cdee315a086c1b55f9fd9a4286bdb1678b\\n\\nOnce you have an idea for your balcony renovation, you can start making sketches or simple drawings. Most interior designers use professional software for their clients, but there are several other options available for those who want to do everything by themselves to save money and create a personal touch. Many new and amateur designers use user-friendly online software and create their own design projects in apps like Planner5d or roomplanner. You can choose whichever you find and start your own journey.\\n\\nHope these simple tips and ideas will inspire and help you transform your balcony into a catchy new space.\", 'Score': 5, 'Total_comments': 1, 'Upvote_ratio': 0.86, 'Post_views': None, 'Post_URL': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmateurInteriorDesign/comments/tqt01r/the_top_3_balcony_design_ideas/', 'Subreddit': 'AmateurInteriorDesign', 'Subreddit_id': 't5_62lve8'}, 858: {'Type': 'Post', 'Post_id': '1at8o2q', 'Title': 'Help with some kind of app or program to help visualize', 'Author': 'New-Factor-1158', 'Created': '1708194601.0', 'Text': \" I need a tool that lets me view various options for our home rebuild.

However, it is critical to stay in line and not overdo the accents. But how to easily create catchy accents for any interior design?\\n\\n**#1 – Color Accent**\\n\\nIt is smart to stick to the 3 colours rule in interior design. It means that 60% of the room uses primary colour, 30% – is the secondary shade, and just 10% is the accent tone.\\n\\n[60\\\\/30\\\\/10 Rule](https://preview.redd.it/0tws8xcz3zz81.png?width=580&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bab4c52677f149dc872653509223c89dd2f2c6a)\\n\\nOverdoing the accents can blend the overall picture and make your room undefined.\\n\\n**#2 – Furniture Accent**\\n\\nFurniture is a great way to add an accent to interior design. In fact,  some interior designers use furniture as the primary way to create an accent in their projects.\\n\\n[Furniture Accent](https://preview.redd.it/so57kz824zz81.jpg?width=6000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=65cdd3c24233227d6378fddec1e2e6e49f7f9710)\\n\\nOttomans, small coffee tables, or cosy dressers will work just fine. What’s more, you can always replace them or repaint them on short notice, meaning much greater flexibility than playing with colours.\\n\\n**#3 – Plants/Flowers Accent**\\n\\nSome homeowners neglect plants and flowers in their interior design, but they shouldn’t. Not only greenery can add an accent to a room and make it more welcoming, but it also purifies the air and creates a more relaxed atmosphere.\\n\\n[Plants\\\\/Flowers Accent](https://preview.redd.it/dd1g3ol34zz81.jpg?width=3600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=940a29095ac9516d9d297f6a5b5a4f30f59f642c)\\n\\nThe only downside might be the extra care needed for some plants and flowers. However, some plants require minimal maintenance, while their benefits are hard to overestimate.\\n\\n**#4 – Stained Glass Accent**\\n\\nWhile quite rare, stained-glass windows are another win-win solution for creating an accent to a room.\\n\\nCreate various patterns and drawings, or simply try different colour options to set a new mood for your interior.\\n\\n[Stained Glass Accent](https://preview.redd.it/oqkp47o54zz81.jpg?width=4896&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5c6a5adb29b3cefa96c78805855d9bbd06e627f5)\\n\\n**#5 – Pillow And Blanket Accents**\\n\\nPillows and blankets might lighten up even the dullest room. A key thing to remember here (like with all accents) is keeping it moderate not overdoing it.\\n\\n[Pillow And Blanket Accents](https://preview.redd.it/qmga0tz84zz81.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7670e486e2e3f3d56edf717b2aafc259f36e67d2)\\n\\n**#6 – Painting Accents**\\n\\nFinally, the most popular solution for accents is paintings. Pictures of fine woods and seas might create a relaxed ambience, while wildlife and modern art bring zest and originality.\\n\\n[Painting Accents](https://preview.redd.it/t61k6jed4zz81.jpg?width=6016&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d5bbe264ce84ed20006629ffb37ae38356ea6c5c)\\n\\nUnlike several other options, paintings are the most flexible and universal solution.', 'Score': 11, 'Total_comments': 1, 'Upvote_ratio': 1.0, 'Post_views': None, 'Post_URL': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmateurInteriorDesign/comments/urfiyw/how_to_create_accents_in_interior_design_an_easy/', 'Subreddit': 'AmateurInteriorDesign', 'Subreddit_id': 't5_62lve8'}, 863: {'Type': 'Post', 'Post_id': 'v6sviy', 'Title': 'Just got two new pieces for my bedroom (last two pics).
