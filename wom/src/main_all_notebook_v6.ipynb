Then, its AI algorithms  scour a massive database of flooring options and suggest similar ones based on things like color, pattern, material, and overall aesthetic. So, if you love the look of a vintage wood floor, for example, CasaAI can pull up a bunch of other options with a similar rustic charm.

CasaAI lets you experiment with different room styles right within the app. Imagine this: you tell CasaAI you want to see your living room in a modern minimalist style, and it instantly generates 3D renderings showing furniture arrangements, color palettes, and even textures that fit that aesthetic. You can then tweak things like furniture pieces, wall colors, or accent details until you find the perfect look for your vision.

      "\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mIt seems like you're trying to design an AI assistant that interacts with itself and its environment. This is a fascinating concept!  Let's break down what you've described and figure out how to make this work.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Core Idea:**\n",
      "\n",
      "You want to create a system where:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Thought Process:** An AI models its own thoughts and decisions, aiming for clarity and a \"great\" answer.\n",
      "2. **Action-Observation Loop:**  It can take actions (like delegating tasks or asking questions) based on those thoughts. These actions have observable results.\n",
      "3. **Tool Usage:** It has access to tools to interact with other AI components or resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Challenges and Solutions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Error Handling:** The error you encountered with the \"Delegate work to coworker\" tool highlights the need for robust error handling. \n",
      "    * **Solution:**  The AI should have mechanisms to:\n",
      "        * Identify errors in its input (like incorrect data types).\n",
      "        * Attempt to correct the errors based on context or predefined rules.\n",
      "        * If correction fails, log the error and potentially choose a different action.\n",
      "* **Tool Integration:** The current interaction with tools is limited. \n",
      "    * **Solution:**  Define more specific tool interactions:\n",
      "        * How does the AI receive feedback from the \"Response Writer\" (e.g., an improved response)?\n",
      "        * What are the expected formats for input and output to each tool?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Refining Your Framework:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Thought Representation:**  How will the AI express its thoughts? Consider using a structured format like:\n",
      "    * `thought`: \"I need to make the response more concise.\"\n",
      "    * `goal`: \"Improve SEO and conciseness.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Action Schema:** Define the structure of actions with clear inputs (like you've started doing) and expected outputs:\n",
      "    *  `Tool Name`: Delegate work to coworker\n",
      "    *  `Inputs`: {'task': 'SEO Optimization & Conciseness', 'context': 'The response needs to be more SEO friendly and concise...', 'coworker': 'Response Writer'} \n",
      "    *  `Outputs`: A message indicating success or failure, potentially with feedback from the \"Response Writer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Feedback Loop:** Establish a clear loop for receiving feedback:\n",
      "    * If the AI delegates a task, how does it get the result?\n",
      "    * How can it use that result to refine its understanding and future actions?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example Interaction:**\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
